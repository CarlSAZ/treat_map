# treat_map - Our mission
A fun project aimed at crowd sourcing the best streets for Halloween fun

Have you ever noticed how some streets in a neighborhood get significantly more attention during Halloween than others? Sometimes this might be a neighborhood with a reputation of giving out the fabled full-size candy bar. Or maybe there is a few houses that have gone all out with decoration and have a giant skeleton peering over their roof! Trick-Or-Treaters have limited time on their night to explore the neighborhood and have fun. Our project aims to give a helpful nudge toward areas of activity that can lead toward organic exploration.
