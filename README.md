# treat_map - Our mission
A fun project aimed at crowd sourcing the best streets for Halloween fun

Have you ever noticed how some streets in a neighborhood get significantly more attention during Halloween than others? Sometimes this might be a neighborhood with a reputation of giving out the fabled full-size candy bar. Or maybe there is a few houses that have gone all out with decoration and have a giant skeleton peering over their roof! Trick-Or-Treaters have limited time on their night to explore the neighborhood and have fun. Our project aims to give a helpful nudge toward areas of activity that can lead toward organic exploration.

## User stories
Community members and Prospective Trick-Or-Treaters will have access to the TreatMap starting a few weeks before Halloween. Users of the app can provide an impression of the street by ranking several qualities -- traffic, saftey, spooky, decorations, treat speculation, and most importantly vibes. These will combine with a low-precision geolocation from the device and get sent to our database to be aggregated.

Then in the days before Halloween, the map mode of the application will open up. Users will be able to see a heat map with the different layers for each quality in their nearby location. Additional layers will highlight other available data such as typical traffic levels for the night on each road.
